// lib/midifile.hpp -- midifile.lib's interface: Standard MIDI Files read into UMP events in time,
// and a player that sends them to any MIDI destination ahead of their time, time-stamped
// (docs/MIDI.md section 10). A program that includes this links with midifile.lib at load time.
//
//   midifile::Song *s = midifile::open(data, size, &err);    // the file in memory: read whole
//   midifile::Player *p = midifile::player(s);
//   p->start(u::clock().ticks);
//   while (p->pump(writer, u::clock().ticks)) { ... wait a frame ... }
//
// A Song is the file's events in time order -- every track's merged, MIDI 1.0 channel voice
// messages as UMP type 2 and SysEx as type-3 packets, each at its time in microseconds from the
// start (the file's tempo map applied: format 0 and 1; a format 2 file's tracks one after
// another). The player writes them to a midisvc::Writer up to `ahead` before they are due, each
// stamped with its time, so the destination (the Instrument Host) starts each on its sample.
//
// TIME (since 0.6.1): ticks a quarter note through the tempo map, or SMPTE -- 24, 25, 29.97 (drop-frame,
// coded 29) or 30 frames a second and ticks a frame, the tempo map then ignored, as the format says.
// Times stop at 2^40 us (12.7 days): a file whose deltas add up past that ends there. Every track
// the header names and the file holds is read (64 at most before 0.6.1).
//
// GS, XG AND GENERAL MIDI 2 FILES are Standard MIDI Files like any other: what makes them so is in
// their messages -- SysEx, bank select, RPN and NRPN -- which are read and sent as they are; the
// synthesizer is what knows them. Since 0.6.0: a SysEx divided over F7 events read whole, an F7
// escape holding a SysEx read as one, RMID files (RIFF), each event's port (FF 21: the 32-channel
// files of two ports), and a seek that puts each RPN and NRPN back as the song set it.
//
// PORTS (since 0.6.0). A file for a two-port synthesizer (an SC-88's or MU's A and B, 32 channels)
// says each track's port with meta event FF 21. The events keep group 0 -- a program that sends
// them to an instrument itself sees the file as before -- and Song::port says each one's. The
// player writes them all on group 0 unless set_groups says the destination takes more: then each
// port's on its own group.
//
// Not this library's name, midi.lib: lib/midi.hpp is the instrument interface, header only, that
// every instrument's user includes (docs/MIDI.md section 6, "As built").
//
// STANDALONE (MIDIFILE_STANDALONE defined): the reader alone -- Event, Song, open -- with no Player and
// nothing of Hira-V's (MidiSvc, libu), for programs outside Hira-V; hvyxg and hvopl3 carry a copy
// made so (their renderers read files with it). Hira-V's build never defines it.
//
// THE CONTRACT (docs/Dynamic-libraries.md section 3): no state in the library; Song and Player
// are the program's (deleted by it), called through their vtables. Event is passed by its layout.
